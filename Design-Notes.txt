- before a new manipulative operation the bitmap needs to be converted to a RGBChannels struct instance
- so that all operation have the same basis
- only the comparision works with Bitmaps and RGBChannels struct as input because there is no manipulative operation on them
- later on the RGBChannels can be converted back to a Bitmap and saved as valid image

- there are different subsystems: 
 - PixelManipulator
 - ConstrastEnhancer
 - FilterManipulator
 - Comparer
 - ColorSpaceConverter
 - Transformer
 that get handled with the Facade Pattern in the ImageProcessor class and used as Singletons

- ColorSpace conversions and transformations get handled directly via subsystem,
whereas the other subsystems furthermore have an additional abstraction hierachy to avoid code duplication
